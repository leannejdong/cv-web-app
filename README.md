## Tech stack

* Front end: React

* Back end: NextJS, or Node.js with Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose

* Database: PostgreSQL
  
* ORM Integration: Prisma ORM. Integrate Mongoose, a MongoDB ODM for Node.js, into your backend code.
Define models for User and Resume using Mongoose schemas.

* Caching: Redis

## General logic

* Develop API Endpoints:
Create API endpoints for creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting resumes.
Implement logic to interact with the database based on these endpoints.

* Testing:
Test the database interactions to ensure proper storage and retrieval of resume data.
Perform tests for different resume structures and user scenarios.

* Iterate and Refine:
Refine the database schema and API endpoints based on testing feedback.
Consider adding features like template management or collaboration options, and adjust the database design accordingly.

* Security Measures:
Implement secure authentication for users.
Ensure proper validation of resume data to prevent malicious input.

* Deployment:

- Set up the production MongoDB environment or use a cloud-based MongoDB service.
- Deploy the resume builder app to a hosting platform.

* Monitoring and Maintenance:

- Implement monitoring for database performance.
- Regularly update and patch MongoDB as needed.

* Scale:

- Monitor app usage and consider scaling strategies if needed, such as horizontal scaling by adding more servers.

The database development process is closely intertwined with the overall development of the app.
